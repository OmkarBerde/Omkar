        1.Step 
        To make delicious samosas at home, first, make the filling.<br> Put a pan on medium flame and add 2 tsp oil in it.<br> Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds and allow them to crackle.<br>
        2.Now, add whole coriander seeds, ginger and green chilli.<br> Saute for a minute and then add chopped cashews and raisins, peanuts if you like them,<br> boiled and mashed potatoes, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, red chilli powder, salt to taste, kasoori methi leaves, coriander leaves.<br> Mix well and saute for 2 minutes. Your stuffing is ready!<br>
        3.Now, to prepare the dough, take a mixing bowl and combine all-purpose flour along with carom seeds and salt.<br> Mix and then add ghee and start kneading by adding a little water at a time.<br> Ensure that you add water gradually and make a firm dough.<br> A soft dough will not make your samosas crispy. Cover the dough with a damp muslin cloth and keep aside for about half an hour.<br>
        4.Once done, roll out few small-sized balls from the dough.<br> Flatten them further with the help of your palms and then with a rolling pin.<br> Give them a round shape and cut in half. Now dip your hands in water,<br> fold the edges of the semi-circle in order to give it a cone shape.<br>
        5.Take the filling with the help of a spoon and stuff it in the cone.<br> Seal the ends properly by pressing the edges lightly with your fingers.<br> Then, heat oil in a pan and deep fry the samosas on low heat until they turn<br> golden brown and crispy. Serve with tomato ketchup and green chutney. <br>Enjoy it as a tea-time snack!<br>

        <h4><b>Tips</b></h4><b>
           1.To make samosas cripsy, make sure you knead a tight or stiff dough as the soft dough will not yield best results.<br>
           2.Before kneading the dough, keep it in mind that you do not need to overwork it and mix<br> the oil with flour at least 5-6 times. This will ensure you have crispy samosas.<br>
           3.You should keep aside the dough for at least 40-60 minutes for best results.<br>
           4.While rolling the dough ball, keep it thin and do not use any flour in it.<br> You can use a little oil to roll the ball evenly.<br>
           5.Always fry the samosas on low flame irrespective of how much time it is taking to fry.<br> This will also ensure that your samosas are blisters free and cooked from inside.<br>
